## Genome-wide Analysis of Groucho Function in **Drosophila** Embryogenesis

* Background
	* Gene regulation
		* Combinatorial approach to gene regulation
		* Spatial and temporal regulation of gene-expression in development
	* Embryogenesis
		* Morphogen gradients designate cell fate in embryogenesis
	* Groucho
		* Groucho is a co-repressor integral to Drosophila development
		* Groucho is recruited by multiple sequence-specific factors
		* Multiple potential mechanisms of Gro-mediated repression
* Investigating the roles of Gro in the early embryo
	* 
* Gro regulation and RNA PolII Pausing
* Conclusion
	* Mechanism
