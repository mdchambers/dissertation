## Genome-wide Analysis of Groucho Function in **Drosophila** Embryogenesis

* Background
	* Gene regulation
		* Combinatorial approach to gene regulation
		* Spatial and temporal regulation of gene-expression in development
	* Embryogenesis
		* Morphogen gradients designate cell fate in embryogenesis
	* Groucho
		* Groucho is a co-repressor integral to Drosophila development
		* Groucho is recruited by multiple sequence-specific factors
		* Multiple potential mechanisms of Gro-mediated repression
* A genome-wide survey of Groucho in the early embryo
* Identifying components of the Groucho gene regulatory network

* What is the mechanism of Groucho mediated repression?
	* Is spreading a universal feature of repression?
		=> peak widths
		=> peak clusters
	* Given Gro has been shown to participate in short-range repression, do we observe binding patterns consistent with this?
		=> Binding in promoters/TSS (I can show TSS density plots of Gro and CtBP here)
	* Is recruitment sufficient for repression?
		=> Recruitment to HOT/highly accessibly chromatin
			I will most likely cut this; it was part of an argument that not all Gro binding to chromatin results in regulation but in retrospect that's a trivial result, as most TFs do, and doesn't address the question in a meaningful way. I'll think about it.
		=> Recruitment to Dorsal-activated genes
		=> Association with all classes of Dorsal binding site
* What genes are direct targets of Gro-repression in the embryo?
	* Do we observe evidence that Gro activates gene expression?
		=> No; very few up-regulated genes observed with high Gro occupancy score
	* Do these genes fit with our current understanding of the role of Gro in developmental regulation and signal interpretation?
		=> GO analysis; network analysis (emphasize unexpected hubs Pnr;Ptc;Tkv)
* What is the relationship between Groucho and RNA PolII pausing?
	* Does nascent-seq as performed actually provide data enriched for nascent pre-mRNA?
		=> Various ways we validated "nascentness"
	* Are Gro-regulated genes enriched for stalled PolII?
		Using Zeitlinger et al, 2007 PolII Chip-seq from 2-4 hr Toll10B embryos
			=> Gro-bound (ChIP-seq) genes are enriched for stalled PolII
			=> Gro-repressed, but not activated (RNA-seq) genes are enriched for stalled PolII
		Validated at all time points using nascent-seq
			=> nascent-seq metagene plot of Gro-regulated genes
