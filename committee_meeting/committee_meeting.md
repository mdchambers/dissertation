* Title: Temporal analysis of groucho mediated gene regulation in the drosophila embryo
* Introduction
	* Gene regulation
	* Groucho
		* Pathway participation
		* Mechanism
		* Domains (structure/function)
		* Conservation
	* RT-PCR of deletion mutants
* Materials & Methods
* Results
	* Identification of Groucho targets by developmental stage
		* Show log2FC of sig genes for LoF and OE lines
		* Highlight genes that show opposite magnitude response (potential primary targets)
	* Groucho is likely an dedicated repressor in drosophila
		* Evidence for TLE3, a human Groucho/TLE family member, to behave primarily as an activator (Tontonoz 2011){Mannervik:2014fp}
		* Heatmap of DE genes with opposite magnitude response
		* GO analysis of targets
	* Nascent-seq (likely RNA-seq are a good estimation of transcription rate, not just abundance)
		* PCA analysis? log2FC plot?
	* Analysis of groucho occupancy
		* Groucho recruitment is more dynamic during early embryonic development
			* Thousands of binding regions at each timepoint
			* Major shift between TP1 -> TP2 (less of a shift TP2 -> TP3)
	* Capicua mediated recruitment
		* GOI: hkb, ind, tll
		* Groucho localizes to TSS and enhancer regions
		* Groucho occupancy persists at TSS after being lost at enhancer
	* Zelda interaction
* Discussion
