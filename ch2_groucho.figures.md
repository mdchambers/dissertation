**Figure 2-a. Groucho ChIP-seq experiments show high reproducibility in read mapping and peak calling** **(A)** ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced to a depth of ~20M reads, twice the recommended library sizes for ChIP-seq experiments proposed by the moENCODE consortium.{Landt, 2012 #308} **(B)** *(left)* Overall mapping profiles of ChIP-seq sequenced reads cluster by timepoint. Timepoint 2 and 3 samples cluster more closely together than timepoint 1, which diverges significantly from both other timepoints. Dark green indicates a higher correlation by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (a value of 1 indicates perfect correspondence). *(right)* Peak calling was performed with MACS2 and called peaks were clustered by similarity. **(C)** Replicate similarity was confirmed using principal component analysis

**Figure 2-b. Peaks present in both replicates were preserved for further analysis** Peaks present in both replicates were obtained from each timepoint and used for further analysis. Overlapping peaks were identified as those having at least 1 basepair overlap with a peak in its matchign replicate. Samples exhibited a replicate overlap rate of approximately 35% of all peaks, for the first and third timepoint, and 61% for the middle timepoint.

**Figure 2-c. A large number of Groucho binding regions are preserved throughout all stages analyzed.** **(A)** While a significant fraction of Groucho binding sites are unique to each of the three timepoints analyzed, several are preserved across two or more timepoints. No detected Groucho peak was present in only early and late timepoints, indicated that during the timepoints analyzed removeal of Groucho binding from a locus was a permanent regulatory decision. Additionally, while the middle and late timepoints have a significant fraction of binding sites in common, the early and middle timepoints have very few in common. This is indicative of Groucho genomic localization being relatively dynamic during early timepoints when compared to later times. **(B)** Approximately 1500 peaks were called in both anti-Gro and input libraries. These are most likely the result of DNA isolation, library preparation, or read mapping effects and were removed from further analyses.

**Figure 2-d. A larger number of genes are associated with a smaller grouping of genes at each timepoint.** The most probably Groucho regulated gene associated with each binding region was identified by identifying the closest TSS site to that gene. This method has been shown to be instructive in predicting TF/gene interactions, though due to the complexity of the Drosophila genome and both the numerousness and distant location of enhancer regions, this technique is prone to high type I and II error.

**Figure 2-e. Groucho binding is enriched in promoters, introns, and 5' UTRs at all timepoints** **(A)** Heatmap of statistical enrichment of Groucho binding as determined by ChIP-seq over three time spans. Enrichment (yellow) or depletion (blue) of mapped reads across several feature types is show. Groucho exhibits the strongest enrichment in 5' UTRs, with slight enrichment in both promoters regions (defined as within 500 bp upstream of the TSS) and intronic regions. Average levels of reads were mapped further upstream (500 - 2000 bp), while regions further away were depleted for Groucho binding (2,000 - 20,000 bp). **(B)** Mapping the location of Groucho binding peaks versus each peak's nearest feature reveals that Groucho preferentially binds within gene bodies, with over half of all Groucho binding at the middle and late timepoints occurring within gene bodies. Groucho binding outside of genes is approximately evenly split between binding upstream and downstream of its nearest feature.

**Figure 2-f. Groucho is preferentially recruited to gene bodies at all timepoints.** Mapping the location of Groucho binding peaks versus each peak's nearest feature reveals that Groucho preferentially binds within gene bodies, with over half of all Groucho binding at the middle and late timepoints occurring within gene bodies. Groucho binding outside of genes is approximately evenly split between binding upstream and downstream of its nearest feature.

**Figure 2-h. The majority of Groucho binding within gene bodies binds within introns.** 


**Figure 2-h. Average Groucho peak widths suggest spreading is an limited phenomenon.** Groucho binding regions have a median width of between 500 and 700 bp. This binding pattern is more consistent with a transcription factor localizing to a small area of chromatin than with the spreading model that has been theorized to explain the association of Groucho with chromatin. However, at all three timepoints, there are a significant number of outlier Groucho peaks exhibiting wider binding.
