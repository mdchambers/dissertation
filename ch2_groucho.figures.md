**Figure 2-1. Groucho ChIP-seq experiments show high reproducibility in read mapping and peak calling** **(A)** ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced to a depth of ~20M reads, twice the recommended library sizes for ChIP-seq experiments proposed by the moENCODE consortium.{Landt, 2012 #308} **(B)** *(left)* Overall mapping profiles of ChIP-seq sequenced reads cluster by timepoint. Timepoint 2 and 3 samples cluster more closely together than timepoint 1, which diverges significantly from both other timepoints. Dark green indicates a higher correlation by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (a value of 1 indicates perfect correspondence). *(right)* Peak calling was performed with MACS2 and called peaks were clustered by similarity. **(C)** Replicate similarity was confirmed using principal component analysis

**Figure 2-2. Peaks present in both replicates were preserved for further analysis** Peaks present in both replicates were obtained from each timepoint and used for further analysis. Overlapping peaks were identified as those having at least 1 basepair overlap with a peak in its matchign replicate. Samples exhibited a replicate overlap rate of approximately 35% of all peaks, for the first and third timepoint, and 61% for the middle timepoint.
